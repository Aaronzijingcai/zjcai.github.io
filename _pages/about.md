<!-- ## About me -->
<br>Hi! I am Zijing Cai. Previously, I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Technology(advised by [Prof. Hua Zhang](https://scie.zjgsu.edu.cn/zh-hans/node/381)) from the Zhejiang Gongshang University in 2024.

My research interests lie broadly in language model - check my [publications](https://aaronzijingcai.github.io//publications/) or [CV(PDF)](https://aaronzijingcai.github.io//cv/) for more information. I am open to other topics as well; feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like to chat! 

(This webpage was last updated on **Jan. 2025**)

## Research Interests
* **Pre-trained Language Model**, investigating how to leverage the rich prior knowledge in pre-trained language models to accomplish general tasks, with a particular focus on machine reading comprehension and prompt-based learning frameworks.
* **Contrastive Learning**, focusing on leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the quality of embeddings and to enable more nuanced and context-aware language model performances.
* **Dual Learning**, utilizing the primal-dual structure between machine learning tasks to obtain effective feedback/regularization, guiding and reinforcing the learning process, thereby reducing the requirements for large-scale learning.

## Recent news

* *Jun, 2024* [**Multi-schema prompting powered token-feature woven attention network for short text classification**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320324005338) accepted to **Pattern Recognition 2024**!
